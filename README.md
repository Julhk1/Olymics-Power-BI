Power BI Dashboard: Paris 2024 Olympics Medal Analysis! 🏅

I've created an interactive dashboard for the Paris 2024 Olympics, where I've analyzed and visualized:

🌟 Total medals won (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
🏆 Top 5 countries with the highest medal counts
💸 Financial reward distribution by country and total rewards paid for each medal type

This dashboard not only highlights the performance of various countries but also provides insights into the financial aspects of the rewards. It's a great way to see how different nations are performing and investing in their athletes.
